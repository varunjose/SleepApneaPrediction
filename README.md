I have developed a deep learning model for predicting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using facial depth maps. 
By analyzing facial features and their 3D structure, 
the model leverages advanced neural networks to identify subtle indicators of sleep apnea, 
providing an innovative, non-invasive method for early detection and diagnosis of the condition.
